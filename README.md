# informedDialogues
globaldialogues.ai routinely ask people from around the world about how theyâ€™re interacting with and impacted by AI systems.  To date, this data has informed AI development, evaluation, and governance around the world. 

This repository aims to follow down this path.

The general idea is to use the diversity in regional poll results to inform prompt templates for LLMs.
For this we build a pipeline to automatically be able to update the prompt templates while the database further develops.
Design appropriate prompt templates which guide and govern the LLM behavior.
And wrap it all in a frontend which makes the work tangible and interactive.
